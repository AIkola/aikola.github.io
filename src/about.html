    <p> <br>
        I help companies to increase revenue by acquiring, engaging and retaining their customers in digital channels.
        <br><br>
        I work with B2B and B2C businesses who have recognized the importance of customer experience as a key driver for sustainable growth and customer loyalty.
        <br>
        I am inspired to help companies in:<br>
        1) coming up with unique digital growth strategies<br>
        2) building the needed competences for modern digital sales<br>
        3) defining processes and choosing the right technologies that enable agile growth in digital channels.
        <br><br>
        I strive to create measurable business impact with every organisation I work with.
