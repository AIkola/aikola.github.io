    <p> <br>
        I'm a person who has always been deeply interested in both business and technology. This curiosity led me first to study Information Analytics and Knowledge Management in technical university, and later to working in business-driven IT consulting. During my professional career in I've had the pleasure see many industries and contexts, from technology and customer strategies to deep architecture, application and platform development.
<br><br>
I see myself as a lifelong learner with entrepreneurial spirit. This is manifested in analytical skills to grasp an essence of a given challenge, as well as, a strong bias toward action to resolve.
<br><br>
Always eager to help, collaborate, network and innovate. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anttonikola/">Feel free to connect over LinkedIn.</a>Â
